Came back to Standard and see what I can do to enable the same crazy level of looting.  This is what I currently have in Standard:  \- \~5 mirrors  \- Some legacy IIQ items (+20 IIQ amulet, full stat legacy Ventor, IIQ gem, legacy Divination Distillate flask).  \- Some legacy items (melding, adorned, settler weapons)  I am deciding between   1)  a new MF build with the currency and legacy gears I already have, OR   2) a uber strong build that can do super juiced maps.  **For MF build**: I have done the research over the years, 5 mirrors are on the low end of MF investment. That being said, I am okay not doing most juiced content, as long as it gives the same crazy drops. The thing with standard is that there are OP builds that don't cost a fortune due to legacy interactions, like settler weapons, legacy harvest gears, infinite vaal, i.e. the broken stuff. Let me know if there is anything i can try putting together within 5 mirrors with the IIQ gears I already have (the 3 jewellery slots). I have tried TS/LS Deadeye, ESoH Warden, not using the 3 jewellery slots are build-breaking for me as it doesn't survive a sneeze from white mobs in T16.   \- If i were to take this route, what maps should I be running to see good drops?  **For uber strong build**: I have a few uber strong builds that can breeze through deli t17, insta phase uber bosses. My most powerful build is a MSoZ Jugg, but it's impossible to use any MF stuff without breaking the build except a flask spot which i used a wine of the prophet.

Disconnect,(Spoilers Extended) The disconnect between GRRM’s Sansa and the Sansa we read,424,255,2026-01-27,"So it's no secret that the series was originally meant to cover far more time than it ultimately did. I won’t bring up the five-year gap since that’s been done to death but I think it's worth stressing that the gap was a late solution GRRM only arrived at it after realizing his approach wasn’t working.  &gt; GRRM: **Originally, there was not supposed to be any gap. There was just supposed to be a passage of time, as the book went forward.**  &gt; **My original concept back in 1991 was, I would start with these characters as children, and they would get older. If you pick up Arya at eight, the second chapter would be a couple months later, and she would be eight and a half and then she'd be nine. This would happen all within the space of a book. But when I actually got into writing them, the events have a certain momentum. So you write a chapter and then in your next chapter, it can't be six months later, because something's going to happen the next day. So you have to write what happens the next day, and then you have to write what happens the week after that. And the news gets to some other place. And pretty soon, you've written hundreds of pages and a week has passed, instead of the six months, or the year, that you wanted to pass. So you end a book, and you've had a tremendous amount of events — but they've taken place over a short time frame and the eight-year-old kid is still eight years old.**  What I want to discuss is how this failure to meaningfully age the characters changes the context in which their actions are read, especially Sansa’s.  Sansa’s culpability in Ned’s downfall has always been contentious. GRRM has repeatedly stated that she bears real responsibility (though not all her fault), and the text itself backs this up via Cersei. Yet many readers are understandably deeply uncomfortable with this framing, because Sansa is **11 years old**, and assigning blame to a child in an extremely stressful situation feels cruel.  &gt;**""Littlefinger made the ",https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1qoayy4/spoilers_extended_the_disconnect_between_grrms/

This is not some ""ooga booga PC master race"" post like some of y'all assume from the title alone. Read the **post and comments**, damn it.

This is a discussion about theoretical solutions without either discontinuing older console support, nor adversely limiting their player pool as opposed to PC players. It's about finding a balance and a better matching system.  **Edit 2**: I have been informed that a lot of the issues are due to the CPUs of older consoles as opposed to actual networking hardware. This is good to know but doesn't really change the crux of the post, unfortunately.  **Edit 3**: No, disabling cross-platform play does not fix this, since that puts me with other people who have it specifically disabled, which shrinks the possible pool of players for you, instead of giving you a better client experience. It's virtually impossible to get a 4-man random pub squad for a fissure this way after a dozen attempts.

Path of Exile,"Is it just me or does Path of Exile 2 lack build ""freedom""?",319,260,2026-01-26,"My favorite part about Grim Dawn is the fact that I can pick pretty much any ability or damage type at random and puzzle out a build based off of it. Maybe I want to pick the Arcanist's laser beam spell and make a poison-based build off of it. With some conversion elbow grease and a lucky drop or two it will almost certainly end up working even if it's not ""meta"".  After a couple hundred hours of PoE2 I feel like for all the emphasis on synergies and combo-based gameplay, the only combinations that actually work through endgame are the ones that were expressly laid out and accounted for by the devs. If I like Mercenary's fragmentation rounds, I'll have to go cold damage/freeze or I'm hamstringing it. If I pick a spear skill, the only skills that pair well with it are other spear skills. If I pick a sorceress spell, it generates remnants that only other sorceress spells make use of.   I feel like I can't, y'know, get weird with it. It's not a problem of build *variety*; there's lots of different playstyles to choose from. But it feels very difficult to just come up with an idea to put two skills together and have them work if they weren't already designed to do so.  Is it a skill issue on my part? Am I playing PoE wrong? Do you think it'll ever change?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ARPG/comments/1qn7m9n/is_it_just_me_or_does_path_of_exile_2_lack_build/

Endgame,I was watching Endgame again and I noticed something…,3419,302,2026-01-25,"When the Avengers go back in time to collect the Infinity Stones, Bruce encounters the Ancient One while searching for the time stone. She describes that the stones are key for keeping their universe in balance: removing one or all would create a rift in their timeline, which would leave them vulnerable to universal evils and most likely the destruction of their timeline.  In the original timeline, before the Time Heist, Thanos “used the stones to destroy the stones” so the Avengers couldn’t bring back the people from the snap (Thus why they needed to go back in time). After the final battle at the Avengers Compound, Cap needed to return all of the stones they borrowed from the past timelines to keep their promise to the Ancient One.  Therefore, after all is said and done, the main MCU timeline is still without their original Infinity Stones. I was wondering if this is the reason that Doomsday, and the eventual reset caused by Secret Wars, is the result of a rifting/dying universe (or collision of universes to explain the Fantastic 4’s and the X-men’s involvement) caused by the Stones (or lack there of). Or maybe the lack of stones is drawing some sort of evil into their universe, which caused the creation of MCU Doctor Doom.  I think it might be pretty solid, but then again it could be anything at this point. I was wondering what your guy’s thoughts on it were?  TLDR: the main MCU Infinity Stones are still destroyed, thus causing the timeline(s) to collapse/draw in otherworldly evils which could cause Doomsday and Secret Wars.",https://i.redd.it/eboi9sasudfg1.jpeg

Many people got similar queues for all dates they ticketed for. So you were basically blessed or very much screwed over. If you’re advertising a queue to be random then I think there should be people who see very different results among shows. But today for 6 shows, my queues were always 40-50k. My friend always 10-20k. And another friend was always 70-80k. Only my first friend was able to get us tickets.  I’m really surprised this isn’t talked about more when it happens during every Ticketmaster queue. For in demand shows, some people will get to go to all the dates they want while some can’t go at all because they keep getting bad queues. I don’t know what Ticketmaster is doing but this clearly doesn’t seem random to me.   What I do think Ticketmaster does is “randomly” give some accounts boosts for periods of time like that content creator in my prior post. But those don’t last as he got awful BTS queues. Many speculate Ticketmaster has some sort of account ranking algorithm and I don’t think they’re wrong but clearly no one knows exactly how it works. I wouldn’t be so against this if it didn’t completely condemn you across the board if you’re ticketing for every event and they rank you very low. This is why you gotta ticket in groups so hopefully one person has a “good account”. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/kpopthoughts/comments/1qkawcy/so_after_bts_ticketing_isnt_it_pretty_clear_that/

Shop,"Why does Asia have so many high-end/creatively designed shopping malls (compared to elsewhere, like America)?",2852,708,2026-01-23,"I was at a shopping mall in Phuket yesterday (called Central) and was absolutely blown away by the place. The variety of high-end to mainstream brands, the aesthetic interior design, the amount of food options, and just the general energy of the place. People were having a good time eating, shopping, hanging around. My pictures don't do the place justice, but Central is HUGE.  And it's not just in Thailand. I was in Tokyo, Taipei and Hong Kong recently. The sheer amount and quality of malls amazed me. Even food chains that are almost gone in the US are filled with people here (Sizzler).  In comparison, in the U.S. i think everyone can agree shopping malls are pretty much dead/ghost towns. The only places you could find decent shopping centres are in New York, Chicago and maybe pockets of luxury near Los Angeles. But the mall designs in America are incredible boring. Basically designed like a giant cross with 2 levels.  In Asia, I don't even know how you could build absolute mazes of multiple shopping centers that span multiple levels/blocks, often with basement walkways/sky bridges that connect to each other and intermingled among commercial buildings. Always bustling with people. It's so easy to get lost and spend a whole day just eating and window shopping in Asia.

There was only 8 minutes left in the raid and I saw no other Raider shooting it or causing it damage during the fight.  I killed it and several flying arc came in. I fought them off only to see another Raider, who came out of nowhere, lotting it up. By the time I got back over to it, it was gutted and picked almost completely clean by this raider.. No comms, no emotes, nothing from the other Raider.. He instantly ran off when I said something and headed straight for extract..  Had the person asked, I would have told them to loot it up and I'd make sure to cover them from ARC while they loot. I would have also offered for them to use my hatch key..  I don't need the loot as I have 10.5 million space dollars, my work benches are all level 3 etc. I usually load into raids with only a Hullcracker to fight the ARC..  Also, yesterday I unlocked a room on Buried City and I start looting it. Another Raider comes in and also starts looting. Again, no comms, no emote, no nothing...  1. If you don't participate in killing it, ask before looting it. 2. If you didn't burn your key to unlock the area, ask before entering and looting..

This is okay when the plot and world around them is moving onward and interesting things are happening.  I wish I could say the plot moved quickly to make up for it but it didn’t!  I kept begging for the plot to return. Someone’s beheading people? Let’s solve it! Let’s unravel the mystery! No, actually you’re going to read about a woman make perfume and then deliver perfume and then make more perfume and then deliver that and then pick moss for perfume.

He was probably looking at that OTHER woman”  “Ohh booo why would she ever love a silly old paladin I’m just a weirdo who makes socks booooohoooo”  Oh my god. Please stop the self pity.

Loot,Suggestion: Raiders with high loot value are surrounded by a glowing aura.,2771,777,2026-01-22,"Right now it is too hard to tell which players in the game have a lot of loot on them. More often than not when I take my Lvl 4 Torrente and Heavy Shield into Stella Montis I generally just end up killing a bunch of schmucks with Free Loadouts who haven't even looted anything, and nothing to show for my efforts. I spend more money on Medium Bullets than I get from looting these low value raiders - it's just not worth it in the game's current state.  If Embark were to update the game so that raiders with high loot value were surrounded by a powerful glowing aura, that would make it so much easier to determine which players I should prioritize hunting down. This glow should also act as a light, illuminating these raiders so that they cannot hide in the dark.  I have provided an example of what this might look like, but ideally Embark could make the glow even more powerful - as if the player was surrounded by the light of a thousand suns.",https://i.redd.it/ff7hs1v8qreg1.png

It's dumb.   ETA: My opinion on this is not limited to marathons, that was just an example.   Baseball: Hit the ball out of the park but break your ankle rounding third base and can't make it to home? No home run, sorry. The defense sure as heck shouldn't help you make it to home base.   Football: Return the ball 99 yards then drop it prior to entering the end zone? No touchdown. The defense does not pick up the ball and hand it to you so you can feel good.   Chess: Two obvious moves from checkmate then you have an aneurism and can't finish the game? You forfeit sorry.  Soccer: This would be an exception. As it is an 11-on-11 team sport, if one player is injured through no fault of their own, that gives an unfair advantage to the other team. It is customary in soccer to kick the ball out of bounds in that case and I will allow it. But if they don't and keep playing until the ref stops play, I am fine with that as well.

Any ways to make it better if I even should.  Which route would be best to go down, Chaotic little barbarian, or Giant little barbarian? Should I lean into wild or giant, mainly for future subclass, the options wild path or giant path. Both sound great, both fit fairy or giant. One sounds super fun and chaotic which could more fun, leaning into the chaotic side of the fairy. One sounds more strong, which while less fun could still be fun, leaning into the giant backstory kinda, only he’s just raised by giants not actually having a literal connection to them.

He believes he is actually a giant, just a tiny one.  The giants named him Smárvenn, meaning Tiny Friend. Then, inherent the super intelligent last name of his stone giant family, Rockstone.

Uber Unique,My thoughts on LA Metro as a tourist from D.C.,354,68,2026-01-18,"Hello, I recently visited LA (and a few surrounding cities) for 3 days after last visiting in 2023, and I largely relied on public transportation to get around. I rode the entirety of the A, B, D, K, and some of the E line.  TL;DR - nowhere near as bad as its reputation, but still many issues.  The good:  I was genuinely impressed by the B and D line stations with their unique designs and station art. The DC Metro design is iconic, but every station basically falls into the same few designs and the station art is not as substantial as that of the LA Metro. The Regional Connector also had impressive station art, and my favorite was the elevator bay of Grand Ave/Bunker Hill. I did find it amusing that an elevator bay was a chosen for a station ""only"" 120 feet deep, since DC has some of the longest escalators of any metro system. LAX is truly an impressive station even by global standards.   Coming from DC where my fare can reach $6.75, $1.75 per ride with $5 per day cap is insane value. At one point I ended up in Arcadia and I needed to visit my friend in Redondo Beach, which was roughly 50 minutes by Uber and $114. I instead took 1 hr 45 minutes but $1.75 by metro, since I was not in a rush. I know a lot of people complain about LA Metro being too slow, and it is for those types of trips, but in any other city a trip of 50 miles would be covered by commuter rail and not metro, but unfortunately MetroLink is quite lacking in coverage and frequency, especially on a Sunday  The peak hour ridership also seemed pretty good, with most of those trips being standing room only.   Vagrancy on the trains seemed to be way down from when I last rode in 2023.   Finally, it seemed that many popular stations (especially LAX) and some trains had a decent security presence (not just ambassadors).   The bad:  Bad frequencies. I have no idea why the B and D lines only run every 12 minutes given that they go through what look to be very dense areas. The combined section has a respectable",https://www.reddit.com/r/LAMetro/comments/1qg2hjb/my_thoughts_on_la_metro_as_a_tourist_from_dc/

Paladin,I levelled my blood elf paladin to 60 in 2d14h. This is my story.,1424,369,2026-01-18,"Thunderstrike EU  I found myself in the rare position of excessive free time and (partly because of that) landed on blood elf paladin as main for TBC. I was excited to see how fast I could go with the knowledge of 10+ chars levelled to 60 over all iterations of WoW Vanilla/Classic.   I was honestly a bit bummed that the boost was allowed for the new races, as I was looking forward to a clear race and gasps that the first few high level paladins in Orgrimmar would cause. I have since come around on this opinion, as I also see guildies relieved that they can play the class without any time restriction going into Outland. Having said that, the 56-60 levelling bracket (especially WPL, and I skipped EPL) was insanely crowded and rough. Those last levels made me push through the night to avoid crowds today, getting my final ding at the 18th of Jan 2:30 am.  I had no idea what to expect, and how fast I could go. I am no speed leveller, but normally I take roughly 5 days (pre-TBC). So I was expecting something like 3d12 due to the changed level curve, but I blasted through my expectation. I have a ZG planned with the guild tonight that I will unexpectedly will join as 60! Also, after this post I am touching a lot of grass.  **My preparation**  So as you would expect I constantly had gear upgrades ready to go. Cost-effectively enchanted to give that extra boost and ending with the beautiful Destiny + Crusader to fill out those last levels. At level 1 I skipped Eversong Woods and went directly to my mail box. The enchanted gear + stat boosts tore through the level 4 and 5s around Falconwing Square, getting me out of the crowd.  I had a large supply of elixirs, scrolls, sharpening and potions at every level. Until 30 I was even chugging swiftness potions to get my to my destination faster. I situationally used a water-breathing pot, cats-eye elixir and swim speed potions (I loved this last one).  I grouped with my 60 mage for ports, saving an enormous amount of time.

Drop rate,Suicide rate drops 84% after Japan installs blue lights at Tokyo metro stations,2882,88,2026-01-17,"Using soft LED lights led to an 84% drop in suicide attempts in Japan.   Japan’s innovative use of calming blue LED lighting has achieved a staggering 84 percent reduction in train station suicide attempts.  In an innovative approach to public safety, Japanese railway stations are demonstrating how simple environmental changes can have a profound impact on mental health. By installing high-intensity blue LED lights at the ends of train platforms—areas often chosen for suicide attempts due to their isolation—the East Japan Railway Company has seen a dramatic shift in behavior. Researchers from the University of Tokyo found that these calming lights, which evoke the tranquility of the sky and sea, contributed to a remarkable 84 percent decrease in suicide attempts over a ten-year period. This cost-effective intervention serves as a powerful reminder of how psychological triggers can be redirected through intentional design.  The success of blue lighting is bolstered by findings linking mental health to light exposure, particularly during extended periods of overcast weather. Data suggests that railway suicides in Japan often spike following consecutive days of rain and cloud cover, highlighting a biological need for brightness that these installations help fulfill. While traditional safety measures like chest-high barriers and sliding doors are effective, they are also incredibly expensive and difficult to install in older stations. In contrast, the implementation of blue lighting offers a scalable, affordable alternative that addresses the root of the crisis by soothing the emotional state of individuals in distress before they act.",https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/goodbye-suicide/202501/train-suicides-reduced-by-blue-lighting

Spiritborn,Question about my Quill Volley Spiritborn,1,5,2026-01-15,"Hi all,  I am using this guide from maxroll: [Quill Volley Spiritborn Endgame Build Guide - D4 Maxroll.gg](https://maxroll.gg/d4/build-guides/quill-volley-spiritborn-guide#paragon-glyphs-header)  I switched to the 'ancestral build' because i have the necessary uniques: rod of kepeleke and ring of the midnight sun. I also have  the hesha e kesungi and the harmony of ebewaka.  I dont have full vigor at all when casting Quill Volley, probably because the rest of my gear is really mediocre (not ancestral and hardly the right rolls).  Should i switch back to the 'starter build' until my gear is atleast ancestral and with uniques that have better rolls than what i have now? With the combination of the mediocre rolled uniques and legendaries i also feel quite squishy so i might be better of using a helm for example with more defensive stats.",https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1qcwpr4/question_about_my_quill_volley_spiritborn/

Price,If America invades Greenland the stock market will pay the price,2748,1207,2026-01-15,"Any military action against Greenland immediately escalates into a transatlantic crisis. At best, the U.S. would face sweeping sanctions from the EU and allied economies. At worst, it could spark an armed conflict between NATO members, something the global financial system is absolutely not built to handle.  Markets hate uncertainty, and this would be uncertainty on a historic scale. Trade between the U.S. and Europe would likely be disrupted or frozen, shipping lanes in the North Atlantic and Arctic would be militarized, and global supply chains would seize up almost overnight. Energy prices would spike, markets would panic, and investor confidence would evaporate.  The U.S. economy is especially vulnerable here because it’s heavily dependent on globalized, high tech supply chains. Semiconductors, rare earth processing, advanced manufacturing none of these exist in isolation. If relations with Europe and allied nations collapse, access to critical components and materials would be severely constrained. A tech-driven economy can’t function if it can’t get chips, equipment, or precision manufacturing machinery.  Beyond the immediate economic damage, the long-term consequences would be even worse: capital flight from U.S. markets, a weakened dollar, and a permanent loss of trust in America as a stable anchor of the global system. A move like this won't just be a geopolitical mistake; it would be economic turmoil on a scale we haven't seen in a long time.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1qdd0iu/if_america_invades_greenland_the_stock_market/
Necromancer,"With classes getting reworked, will Necromancer FEELlike a Necromancer?",52,68,2026-01-15,"It seems like their rework idea for the Necromancer is to make him a summoner and actual undead commander, based in their roadmap of reworks and class fantasies. My question is this: Will it actually feel like an army commanding summoner, or will it fall flat and still have just 3 summons and have none be permanent or even actually commandable? My thoughts...are that it will either feel like a summoner of the dead and get nerfed to shit, or feel just as underwhelming and have even Diablo IV stomp it in the Necromancer feel department.",https://www.reddit.com/r/elderscrollsonline/comments/1qctlld/with_classes_getting_reworked_will_necromancer/

What happend to the old bp that at least let you chose ME instead of the prestige if you dont like it? Why is the bp full of blue essence, dont get me wrong, as a new player its good to buy more champs ofc, but for old ones its just savings for Emporium.

Back in September this guy starts booking us for small jobs, maybe twice a month, always different locations. Nice enough dude, asks a TON of questions though. Like what products we use, how we price square footage, what our turnaround times are, stuff like that. I figured he was just one of those detail oriented clients.  Recently I'm at a local business networking thing and someone mentions they just hired a new cleaning company. I ask who and its literally this same guy. Turns out hes been running his own cleaning business the whole time, just started it in August. All those ""jobs"" he hired us for were him basically taking notes on our entire operation.  He even asked me once about our employee retention and I told him we give small bonuses when we hit quarterly goals because it keeps people motivated. Now Im wondering if he copied that too. The whole thing has me stressed and Im glad I at least have some money saved aside from Stаke personally because I might need to pivot some things if he starts undercutting us.

Loot,Loot situation PVE [Discussion],30,99,2026-01-14,"I will start this off with saying, YES i know pve is alot lot easier than PVP and YES i know the loot got nerfed twice and the loot was really op on start of wipe. But now.. I wanna know if anyone is experiencing the same thing. Cutlists. Been farming them for a quest for knives and before the 2nd nerf I got a marked room key or smthing valuable. NOW? I have killed them 3 times today. 12 cultists and 3 priests. I get a diary 3 times. Is this just RNG or is the loot for cultists tanked too?  Don't get me started with marked rooms or keycards on labs. I will be lucky to even get 3-5 stims out of green card. Dorms 314 I get ak and a Cat statue. I did dorms 314 10 i got 1 keycard and it was a yellow one that sells for less than 1mill. So you are telling me you pay 20mill for less than 4million return. Blue folders? Never seen them in my life. Checked every spawn.   To be honest. I don't really care about valuable loot that much ATLEAST give tons of shit items instead of 2 items worth less than 100k in a 2million marked room opening.   Does anyone have any tips to hitting 200million? Cause I am lost now. Nothing seems profitable to any degree besides labyrinth but that isnt even that good anymore either... Please give any suggestions \^ I am just lost at what to do since I am fairly new to tarkov. Labyrinth I run alot. But i barely make 1 million for risking everything.     Just to end this, I am not complaining in any way shape or form. PVE should have less loot than PVP to a quite big degree. But I think this is a bit of a stretch how far loot has gone down. I will keep playing regardless but holy is it bad. IMO marked rooms should be less than 2million at this point.",https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/1qc3ekg/loot_situation_pve_discussion/

Necromancer,"Tired of today's ""necromancers""",572,104,2026-01-14,"I'm really tired of looking at my crystal and see everyone calling themselves a ""necromancer"" this days. It's all over the place! They think they're being cool but they're NOT!  I mean, I'm not into necromancy myself but when I used to lick fairy dust to disconnect myself from my studies I always went looking for a fight with one. It used to be really fun, they had very powerful armies and many backup plans that always made me jump out of my robe from surprise.  Now most of them are weak. Really, these people need to go to a graveyard, dig villager A, villager B and villager C themselves and then make a pact with a fucking demon just to make some bodies stand up and wander aimlessly. They can't even command them!!! And if they're caught they just run like cowards because they're deathly afraid of the inquisition and can't cast any magic to eliminate the witness or to defend themselves. And then they blame their failures on the lack of good corpses lmao  Back in my fighting days necromancers created ego from their own spite to animate the dead by their own means. They had HUGE armies full of lichs, death knights and other powerful, skilled, smart but obedient undeads. And even then they had many other spell in their arsenal to support their armies of kill powerful people for fresh undead soldiers. They could instantly cast things like ""Interdimensional binding tentacles"", ""Soul execution"" and ""Fatberg rain"".  They never complained about not finding fitting bodies because they could kill anything themselves and then make then their undead. They were skilled even in fusing bodies. Example: once I fought a necromancer that made a dullahan so insanely poweful that it could cut through space with sheer force! My multilayered barrier almost didn't resist that! I managed to get rid of the dullahan and the necromancer but the dude somehow revived himself into a lich and came after me in under a month with a big ass undead army. After that I killed him three other times and I",https://i.redd.it/hn6e1wn1o7dg1.png

There's no need to buy a 9060XT and a B580, a 7600XT or even a 6600XT would work, but due to a good price on a specific retail and overpriced second hand market, using two same generation GPUs it's all pros.  Still, both GPUs together, can be bought for less than 1000€, so you don't even get into 5080 territory.  Don't bully me for saying it's a 5090 competitor, I'm just using Nvidia's marketing strategy.

Price,Where the price is headed...,67,96,2026-01-14,"last April and May we got some silver at 32 and 33 an ounce.   It's been less than a year and now it's at around 89.   It doesn't feel like a shock to me. It feels like we had it coming for a long time. For those who knew, this was very predictable.  It is not at all out of the realm of possibilities that silver will hit 135-300 in 2026.   I think based on the current market conditions this is just the beginning of a historical price and ratio shift. Something we, or our parents have never seen in their lifetime. It is also plausible that this could be something that most people who have ever lived for the past 5,000+ years of silver and gold history have never (or rarely) seen this.  The market conditions are a perfect storm of increasing demand, supply and mining decreasing year over year.   We are at a point where the premiums are going to eventually have their own market within 1-5 years. The spot will be irrelevant. You think 14 dollars over spot is high? Wait till it's 2-3x spot. The computer says 300? Well that's cool, go get it at 300. What's the problem? It's out of stock everywhere? That'll be 1,000 for you.   We are headed into uncertain times as far as price is concerned. When I say uncertain I'm not talking about the downside, I'm talking about how crazy and how high it can and will most likely go.   We are headed to a time where the spot will be irrelevant, it will only be a matter of if you can get it physically in your hands.   The ratio between gold and silver will most likely hit 20 in these conditions. There's also a good probability that we will end up seeing a single digit ratio. If it gets bad enough it may be 1:1 gold to silver.  I know this sounds crazy, but this is what happens when you have a perfect storm that has never happened before in history.   This is not a typical year with a slight drop in the ratio closing to make a quick buck. This is not the hunt brothers trying to corner the market. This is not a small financial crisis.

Druid,My Party is Four Fucking Druids Who Only Cast Create or Destroy Water And I'm About to Fucking Drown Myself in the Goddamn Sink,2705,311,2026-01-14,"These soggy little shitheads rolled up with the stupidest goddamn concept I've ever heard. They're all level 1 Druids. They all took Create or Destroy Water and have formed a goddamn leaky league. They have eight spell slots a day between them, and every single one is a war crime waiting to happen. My campaign is a puddle of piss and I'm slipping on it.  - The bandits demanded their gold. The druids didn't fight. They used Destroy Water on the moisture in the bandits' eyeballs. ""They're dehydrated and blinded,"" they said. I argued. They cited the spell's text: ""You destroy up to 10 gallons of water in an open container within range."" ""The human body,"" they stated calmly, ""is an open container. It has holes."" They now rule the road through ocular terrorism.  - I throw a goddamn TROLL at them, thinking, 'Ha! Regeneration, you watery fucks!' They spend six rounds using Destroy Water on its ""bodily fluids."" They're arguing about the troll's cellular water content at the table. ""If we drop its internal moisture by 30%, the regeneration can't function! It's basic biology!"" I am a DM, not a fucking botanist. The troll died shriveled like a raisin. They skinned it and called it ""jerky.""  - These fuckers used Create Water to overflow the castle's cesspool moat just as princess procession crossed the bridge.

They kept a single, shit-caked pearl from her ruined crown. They use it to decide who takes watch. They call it THE BROWN EYE.  - There's a 50-foot chasm. A cool skill challenge, right? Wrong.

We put this thread into place to help gather all the information about this month's updates: What is fixed, what broke, what got released and should have been caught in QA, etc. We do this both to keep clutter out of the subreddit, and provide you, the dear reader, a singular resource to read.  For those of you who wish to review prior **Megathreads**, you can do so [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/search?q=%22Patch+Tuesday+Megathread%22&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all).  While this thread is timed to coincide with Microsoft's [Patch Tuesday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_Tuesday), feel free to discuss any patches, updates, and releases, regardless of the company or product. **NOTE**: This thread is usually posted before the release of Microsoft's updates, which are scheduled to come out at 5:00PM UTC.  *Except today, because... 2026.*  Remember the rules of safe patching:  * Deploy to a test/dev environment before prod. * Deploy to a pilot/test group before the whole org. * Have a plan to roll back if something doesn't work. * Test, test, and test!",https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1qbzwiu/patch_tuesday_megathread_20260113/

The patches will be removed from his jersey after each game, and some will be placed into ultra-rare trading cards.",3306,366,2026-01-13," Source: https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/47589517/source-lebron-james-gets-jersey-patch-mark-23rd-season  SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- When LeBron James takes the court Monday in the city his NBA career started in 2003, his Los Angeles Lakers uniform will look a little different to commemorate the occasion.  James' jersey will have a patch affixed to the upper right chest to celebrate his record-setting 23rd NBA season, featuring a silhouette of his pregame chalk toss and three colored stripes representing the franchises he has played for in Cleveland, Miami and L.A.  James will wear the patch throughout the remaining 46 games of the regular season.  After every game James plays, the patch will be removed from his jersey by the Lakers' equipment manager, dated and then shipped to Topps' production facility in Dallas where it will be authenticated and later inserted into a trading card.  Topps, which launched its first NBA-licensed cards in 16 years in October, introduced a similar jersey patch program with rookies wearing a ""Debut Patch"" on their uniform for their first game and last season's MVP (Shai Gilgeous-Alexander), Defensive Player of the Year (Evan Mobley) and Rookie of the Year (Stephon Castle) wearing a special gold NBA logo on the back of their uniform to later be featured on a trading card.

Endgame,"Endgame, did I do something wrong?",9,15,2026-01-13,"I played Engame for the first time last week. Joined as a randomer in a squad and just hung around zone 1 by myself pretty much.  I got to lvl 35 across a couple of days and then randomly managed to kill myself in a truck (no idea how). Then, I realised I lose everything, including Combat Rating.  So, for the next couple of days, I play Solo and grind back the levels but keep dying to stupid things, including a disconnect.  Fast forward to last night. I'm CR4 but I decide to go in with a squad in the hope of leaching some XP and being able to reappear if I die.  I spend about 10 minutes in Zone 1, then I start getting messages from the other guy in my squad, a level 44 player who swears and cusses because I'm not playing the game properly.  I don't speak in Endgame so I just carried on in Zone 1 and after about 10-15 mins of him constantly whining at me, I left the squad.  Question, what was I doing wrong?  Was he expecting me to head to zone 3 / 4 with him?  I assume I'd die almost immediately as I was CR4 with uncommon weapons, nothing cranked.

Spiritborn,Is spiritborn a decent class to recommend someone who is a more advanced gamer but doesn't really play arpgs?,0,11,2026-01-13,"Hey!   I ""pranked"" a friend by gifting him D4 over christmas and he actually agreed to try it, but I am a bit stumped about what to recommend him to play. He has thousands if not tens of thousands of hours (separately) in games like Counter Strike, Warframe, War Thunder, but based on a recent conversation I had with him, he has very little clue about how arpgs function.  He has some animosity towards Blizzard as a company which will definitely cast a shadow on his opinion of this game (it is dumb, but whatever), yet i want him to have a decent time.   Before anyone says paladin... I personally feel like the paladin that got delivered was tailored towards pleasing the crowds and my friend could not be further from the crowds if he tried. I don't want him thinking this game is basic cause I really enjoy that it is not.  The problem is that I never played a spiritborn cause it gives me a 0 on vibe check, so I only have vague ideas about it. Like it is druid done right, D3 monk, etc.   I mostly only play Rogue and I love the less straightforward key passives, random uniques like the shadowstep boots, damage type interactions, etc. Mostly cause unlike the druid I tried, these can actually function somewhat.  Do the spiritborn aspects actually lead to great combos that you can come across? Is the system meaningful and functional, with depth to it? How fun are the uniques and legendaries? I'm not looking for how powerful any one thing currently is, we are not going for a push. I just wanna show my friend the best class design this game has to offer, is that the spiritborn or am I thinking too much into it?

Patch,26.02 Patch Preview,248,393,2026-01-13,"&gt; ""Patch Preview 26.02!   &gt;**Gameplay Thoughts**  &gt;**- Game Time &amp; Snowballing**: For the most part, our metrics around snowballing have come in and they're not looking any higher than last season (and for average play are lower). This is pretty much the same across every region.   &gt; Game time is also looking slightly longer in each region, and even moreso given that the game starts earlier.   &gt; But at the same time, players have reported that games feel a lot faster. We have a few hypotheses:   &gt; Certainly, downtime with more frequent minion spawns and homeguards makes it feel like there's constant action happening.   &gt; Hitting towers and getting those chunks of damage from crystalline overgrowth both feels more rewarding (and more confronting on the receiving end), so it feels like progress is being made faster, even if it's not actually that much faster.   &gt; Barons are being taken earlier, since they're spawning again at 20 minutes, even though Baron takes are a bit weaker than they were before (gives +150G instead of +300G), so games don't typically end after the first Baron push. Players have often associated the first Baron take with the game being over, but that is a bit less of the case this Season.   &gt; For now, we're not going to make any changes to Snowballing and Game Length, but will continue to monitor how things play out.   &gt; Balancing the needs of the Summoner's Rift audience is pretty tough. There is a section of the audience who really enjoys the slow, methodical form of ""Classical Chess/League"" and at the same time, there are some sections of the audience who love ""Blitz Chess/League"".   &gt; While we don't intend to go all the way down to Bullet chess speeds, we also need to be very responsive to the needs of our audience, especially global players and younger players who are often looking for a game with less downtime and faster pacing.

Uber Unique,Pushing an Awful Build to its Limits: Min-Maxed Mirror Tier Zombie/Skeleton Baron Summoner | POE Keepers Build Recap &amp; Retrospective,851,68,2026-01-13,"Hey everyone, for every league I play I commit to a summoner build and try to see how far I can push it within that season. I'm excited to say that so far this is the highest I've ever taken a character.  I have a soft-spot in making underperforming archetypes work so I chose to try and make something of The Baron, which is a unique helm that has been historically considered weak since its nerfs. I'm a one-build-a-league person so I league-started the build, progressed it into endgame, and reached 40/40 challenges with it.

Buffs from adaptive stances takes me to 10k+ but this still feels very low. I have the same low-health issue when playing rogue (couldn’t max out death trap and dance of one’s for stagnant around level 80~ glyphs.

However, I think the pricing and what you get in return for that pricing aligns very closely with other games, so I would expect this to represent well what we will see on launch.**  # Here is a quick cheat sheet for gacha currency  1 Pull = 500 Oroberyl  1 Origeometry = 75 Oroberyl  10 pull = 5000 Oroberyl  10 Pull on Weapon Banner = 1980 Arsenal Tickets  note: there is no option for single pulls on the weapon banner  # Monthly Card - $5  [Monthly Card](https://preview.redd.it/g7cd1dte3qcg1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba3629efb94a11d0bff7e9ab55b3862ff22bbc9e)  [](https://preview.redd.it/breaking-down-everything-available-in-the-shop-v0-i7y01ynt4pcg1.png?width=1460&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d382d862d94e51bf0b967e93664b9b5adba6f25c)  The monthly card is $5  200 Oroberyl a day for 30 days = 6000 in total  12 Origeometry immediately = 900 Oroberyl  In total it equals 13.8 pulls per month  You also get 1 sanity booster a day (sanity is energy).

Price,Trying all normal priced pasta in my local italian supermarket,7076,435,2026-01-11,"So, being raised in a household where just buying Barilla was a literal no-brainer. I started some years ago making fresh egg pasta and never went back. With durum pasta i still went on to just buy Barilla. And with all the flak the brand is getting i decided to go ahead and buy all the normal priced (as in not super expensive stuff) brands that where on the shelf to compare them.  |Brands|Price per 500g| |:-|:-| |Etna|1,49€| |Molisana Collezione da Chef|1,49€| |Barilla|1,49€| |Molisana (normal pack)|1,69€| |Divella|1,29€| |De Cecco|2,49€| |Molisana Pastificio Extra Di Lusso|2,59€|  This sequece was chosen by how they appeared on my receipt. I made a very simple Sugo of passata, garlic, onions and some vegetable broth i had left over. All pasta was cooked to al dente according to the packaging and finished with some pasta water and a laddle of sauce. Same size of pan, amount of fresh water and salt. Same weight of pasta cooked each time.  **Edit:** I have doubled the scale and adjusted the normal Molisana to show that really above the 7,5 mark, they all do there job well. And even the Etna i will probably use up, none of the where complete failures...  Here is my results:  1. Etna: very incosistent lenghts in the pasta, had the most swelling aif all the pasta. a weird taste of musty old wheat. Bit was firm but not in a good way, seemed inconsistent with the texture. **3/10** 2. Molisana Collezione da Chef: Way better mouth feel than the Etna. Very standard taste of wheat pasta with a firm and nice bite. Pretty middle of the road with not too much of unique flavours, but also means no bad ones... **6/10** 3. Barilla: Weirdly the bite is nice, but the pasta crumbles while chewing. This pasta has a sub-par coating with the sauce, eventhough it had its cook time, the core of the pasta is not cooked through. No real taste of the pasta noticeable. **5/10** 4. Molisana: A nice bite to it. It cooked very well and the sauce clings to the pasta for dear life.

Contrairement à Steam vous êtrs vraiment propriétaire des jeux et vous pouvez même les transmettre à vos enfants. C’est pour ça que je le préfère.

Plus Dracthyr are already shapeshifters this wouldn’t really need heavy lore justification anyway. Don’t judge the art to harshly I’m not that good.  For Evokers especially, Dracthyr form functions a lot like a Druid forms with being locked into mogless forms during combat. So If Dracthyr will never end up getting full transmog support, having unlockable visually distinct forms to chase(like Druids) could be a nice middle ground imo.   I kept the base silhouette the same as the current Dracthyr model here, with forms like that you wouldn’t even have to give up what mogs they can use. But also, if a system like this ever existed there’s no reason it couldn’t be pushed further with things like full Drakonid forms and such.   Just to be clear btw, full Transmog is still better, but I’d be okay with something like this in its place. ",https://i.redd.it/4r82twdg06cg1.jpeg

Head-on charges? Gone. Flanks? Gone. The enemy team starts spamming “HE'S THE WORST CAMPER BRO” in chat. I’m laughing so hard, and this Support guy keeps giving him ammo.  At one point, I hear him mutter, calmly, “They’ll push the doorway. They always do.” And then three enemies walk straight into his shotgun, one after the other. I don’t even know how he’s doing this. He’s just sitting there like it’s a documentary, taking down 27 people without ever crouching, sliding, or using any fancy gadgets.  He puts the controller down and says, “That was relaxing.” I’m convinced the enemy team are probably on Reddit right now thinking, “Who the hell let a 62-year-old find the M1014?”  TL;DR: My dad didn’t embarrass himself.

The audience blizzard is appealing to are the people who chase a fresh launch high, and then quit by the next phase.  The truth the Reddit minority doesn’t want to hear is that pre-nerf raids (outside a couple outliers which still aren’t that hard) are some of the most casual friendly and easy raids in WoW’s history. Post nerf takes something easy and just deletes all engagement and meaningful gear progression.

Battle Pass,Buying the Battle Pass turned this game into a second job and completely burned me out,1267,620,2026-01-08,"**Not gonna lie**, I usually buy the Battle Pass in every game I actually plan to spend time on. It’s always nice to have some side rewards while you’re just playing normally. To me, that’s literally the whole point of a Battle Pass: keep players invested and reward them for their time.  But **BF6’s Battle Pass** is easily one of the most **grindy, time-consuming, and miserable** Battle Passes I’ve ever experienced in any game.  The people who designed this system clearly mastered the art of squeezing as much playtime out of players as possible, turning the game into a **second job**: - You need enough XP to unlock **1 star**, and you need **10 stars just to gain 1 tier**. - The XP required per star keeps increasing, to the point where it takes **2–3 matches for a single star**. - All of this exists to **force you to log in weekly** and grind through a list of challenges / *chores*, which is where most of your time actually goes. - These chores are **terribly designed**. You like playing Medic? Too bad — here are **4 Engineer challenges**, go destroy **10 vehicles with mines**. You enjoy Conquest like a normal Battlefield player? Sorry, best we can do is **Redsec, Gauntlet, Team Deathmatch**, etc. Because otherwise, nobody would touch those modes. - After people complained that Week 1 chores forced Redsec, they “fixed” it by giving us **4 rerolls per week** — only to then give you **exactly 4 Redsec/Gauntlet missions every week**, forcing you to burn all rerolls just to escape them, with none left for anything else.  I work **8–10 hours a day**, only to come home and spend **another 2 hours** doing Battle Pass chores just to keep up — because I was dumb enough to trust BF6 and now I don’t want to waste the money I already paid.  In most other games, you can **finish the Battle Pass just by playing normally and earning XP**. Challenges are optional and only help you progress faster.

I’ve basically finished what I wanted to do in **Diablo 3 Season 37** and **Diablo 4 Season 11** — full build, clearing the highest Torment, and once I hit that point I’m usually done with the season.  Problem is, I still need that ARPG fix while I’m playing other RPGs on the side.  I haven’t really played Last Epoch since around full launch. I remember quitting mainly because I *really* disliked the market system at the time, and I wasn’t a big fan of the idol system either. How are those systems now? Any major improvements or changes?  As for builds:   I previously played an **Acolyte Warlock** build where you open a rift in the ground that shoots a bunch of different projectiles — that build was *super* fun.  Right now I’m considering:  * **Rogue** (not sure which mastery) * **Primalist Shaman** * **Acolyte again**, since the dark mage vibe is always my favorite (Necromancer in Diablo, Warlock in WoW, Witch in PoE, etc.)  Any fun or standout builds you’d recommend?  Or… should I just play **Lost Ark** again instead?   (Please don’t say that 😅)  Edit: Thank you all for the answers, I will wait for the new season to play there, and try PoE2 while I wait.",https://www.reddit.com/r/LastEpoch/comments/1q78g6q/thinking_about_coming_back_to_last_epoch_is_it/

Patch,PSA for how to predict upcoming patches,273,42,2026-01-07,"The best indicator we have (aside from Yoshi actually telling us something) is [this spreadsheet which tracks changes to the Version Number of the experimental server](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1ZANjVfHNdZ7q6jCuKbt_ACmlL2E4ht1Fmks1RrMS3xE/htmlview#gid=0). The biggest indicator that a patch is imminent is if you have a span of 2 days where the Version Number increased dramatically (e.g. by more than 20) each day.  Currently, the experimental server version number hasn’t changed since the 3rd. Consequently, I do not expect a patch today (Tuesday) or within 2 days (Wednesday/Thursday). The version number usually changes a decent amount on Wednesdays and Saturdays (which I assume are days of regularly scheduled internal tests), so if the version number changes a ton on Wednesday and then Thursday, maybe the update drops Friday.  Personally I’m betting that we’ll see a big spike on Saturday and Sunday followed by a release on Monday (for a Monday/Wednesday/Friday schedule of hero releases like last time) but that would just be a perfect repeat of what happened last time and Valve probably isn’t *that* predictable. (Edit: Comments have convinced me that the holiday event probably ends on the 15th and the patch totally won't drop before then, therefore my most realistic guess is Monday, the 19th.)

Queue,"Coming from Dota, solo queue in LoL feels unusually quiet",1323,602,2026-01-05,"I played Dota2 for years(4.7k h) and recently started playing more League solo queue.  One thing I still find strange is how quiet games feel. In Dota, voice is just there, so even with randoms people usually talk. calls, roams, objectives, arguments, everything. In LoL, since there’s no built-in voice, it feels like all communication is pings and short text messages, and most games nobody really says much.  I’m curious how other solo players experience this:  When you load into a ranked game with randoms, how do you usually communicate?   Do you rely only on pings/text, or do people ever try to talk outside the game?   Have you ever tried using Discord or anything similar with random teammates, or do you just not bother?  Not saying one is better  just feels very different, and I’m wondering if this is the normal solo-queue experience.",https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1q4l6up/coming_from_dota_solo_queue_in_lol_feels/

He dives headfirst into a risky situation just as any of us would do passing another marker on the map. He was sent alone on a critically important mission because that's exactly what would happen in the games, countless times our vault dweller been sent on world defining missions alone.

We usually do this if there's a lot of people. If it's my turn to pay and they aren't there yet I just let the person behind me pass, so I don't stop the flow (for obvious reasons). Even though that wasn't the case today, this afternoon another customer was really angry because of this, claiming it was unfair and disrespectful to others that were waiting in line too, since ""you can only wait in line once you finished shopping, not before that"". I have no idea what's the logic behind his point of view, and he didn't even explain it to me then because of how frustrated he was. Is this a cultural thing? Am I wrong here? As far as I know, as a customer you should abide by the rules of the establishment, and the grocery store has no rule against doing this. I didn't prevent other customers or the cashier from  continuing their businesses, and I had to wait in line like everyone else... So, AITA here? If so, please let me know your logic in detail, I'm curious to know if I'm missing anything :3  Update: I need to clarify something. My apologies if I expressed myself wrong, English isn't my native language. When I mean couple of items I'm talking about dog food only, the big bag that's heavy and a small bag with the little treats of different flavors. Everything on the same aile. We forgot to pick it up when we waited in line, and they had to take the shopping cart because it was too heavy to car",https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1q3i2pa/aita_for_waiting_in_line_at_the_grocery_store/
Druid,It's my personal opinion that druid is the second best class this season.,48,88,2026-01-04,"Paladin is the best by far, and it's not close, but I think Druid takes a strong second place spot this season. There are 3 druid builds that work very well, and you can go off script from the meta maxroll builds and they still work well. Pulverize can hit 10 billion with almost no gear, Ravens is super fun, but a little clunky because of the cool down aspect never 100% resetting ravens, you can counter this by just saying, F you to grizzly rage, and using runes plus hard casting petrify, you lose damage, but again still in the billions, and then Boulder, also hits for billions. I'm not sure other classes this season Have 3 very good easy to start end game builds, I know my favorite is Rouge, but it is way harder to gear. None of the druid builds I mentioned even need a mythic to get going. Any thoughts on what class you think takes second place?

PTR,Some thoughts from the TBC Arena PTR,107,92,2026-01-04,"Recently played about 1000 games on the PTR and wanted to share some notes I had for people thinking of getting into it this time around on TBC.  **tl;dr Even if you haven't done arena before I think most players would benefit from the decent weapons** which are easier to get this time around.  * Faster pvp gear AND the rating requirement for weapon is reduced to 1700. Because your personal rating now starts at 1500, you should consider playing arena just for weapons for whatever class you play. That way, if you're unlucky with drops, you still have a nice weapon for most classes. * Get 1700 in 2s for the rating (easier than 1700 3s/5s) and do 3s or 5s for points, because 3s/5s still gives more points.  * All arena gear is about 20% cheaper and you earn ~30% more rating points than last TBC  * Metas are pretty much locked in for a reason. For example, (resto druid + mage) is really just not a good 2s comp for a couple of reasons, and you'll make your life much easier by playing something that's to your advantage. You don't need to play the absolute meta comp to go from 1500 to 1700. * On the meta... don't overthink this. Gnome warriors have distinct advantage over human warriors against mages, but seriously don't worry about it unless you're going for glad or rank 1 (in which case you don't need me to tell you this). All classes pair with a healer, a healing reduction effect (mortal strike, wound poison, etc), or another DPS. * Top winners I think for TBC pvp are going to be healers, almost everyone was looking for a healer (mostly resto druids or priests) because they pair well with almost every class.  * Tons of people playing on PTR, there is still super sweaty players coming from pservers and past rank 1 gladiators, but there also was people experimenting and new to it. * There's too many rogues on PTR and I worry about their expectations for a raiding experience. * Losing is part of increasing your rating long term. Through sheer luck you can lose 7 times in a ",https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/1q32e09/some_thoughts_from_the_tbc_arena_ptr/

On the other hand, I would have had a lot more fun in the &gt;!Hebden Bridge!&lt; episode if I understood a bit more about it. Why does it have those cool canals? How common is it to live in a houseboat there? What's the industry here? When was the town founded?  I'd be perfectly happy to have this info as a VO or as a textbox, but there could be cool ways to integrate it into the episode more naturally too. Maybe when doing tentacles, you have to tell us a bit about the museum you're closest to?  **2. I also want to see them interact with the culture they're in.**  Challenges do a good job of providing this in some other formats (go into a museum? find groceries?), but in Hide &amp; Seek, it's mostly ""walk around and then hide"". This seems a bit harder to do in Hide &amp; Seek format (maybe you could do it with curses, but then you kill a lot more time... etc.).  Not every format has to tick all of these boxes of course (e.g.: Hide &amp; Seek could be more learning-focused, while Tag could be more interaction-focused), but wanted to give my two cents here.",https://www.reddit.com/r/JetLagTheGame/comments/1q2e1s6/i_was_listening_to_the_layover_s16_episode_3_and/

Back in October, I bought a vacuum from Kohl’s online for in-store pickup. It normally sold for around $330, but I paid $250 and got $50 in Kohl’s Cash, which I used the following week. No issues there.  When Black Friday rolled around, I noticed the exact same vacuum was now selling for $150.  I reached out to online customer service to see if they could refund the difference since I had bought it online. They told me they don’t do price matching or price adjustments during Black Friday promotions. Nothing they could do.  While I was chatting with the rep, I looked up my order and noticed the return window was 90 days and I was still well within it. I pointed that out and tried using it as leverage, asking if they could just refund the difference instead of dealing with a return.  Still no.  At that point, I told the rep that if that was the case, I’d return the used vacuum to Kohl’s and just buy it on Amazon instead.  They didn’t budge.  So I did exactly what their policy allowed.  I ordered the same vacuum again from Kohl’s for $150 with free delivery. That purchase also earned me $30 in Kohl’s Cash.  When it arrived, I took the unopened box to my local Kohl’s and returned it using my original $250 receipt from October.  I fully expected them to deduct the $50 in Kohl’s Cash I’d already spent from the refund… but they didn’t.

Disconnect,Are rural areas in the south that rural that they’re disconnected from other communities?,252,532,2025-12-31,"It’s pretty well documented in different movies and TV shows that rural areas in the United States are more rural than what we would call rural areas in the UK. Movies that spring to mind for me include Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and the Wrong Turn series.  As someone who’s a huge fan of country music, it’s really interesting to read about artists like Dolly Parton and Loretta Lynn who grew up in the mountains of Appalachia.  I’ve driven through a couple of rural areas in Osceola County, which has included driving by huge ranch-style mansions and by caravan parks.  I know it’s a really broad question, but does the rural south look like how it does in the movies, and are some places that incredibly rural there’s a disconnection from others?",https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnAmerican/comments/1pzs4u6/are_rural_areas_in_the_south_that_rural_that/

Rogue,My (35/F) sister (25/F) has a bridesmaid (25/F) gone rogue,9072,488,2025-12-31,"**I am not The OOP, OOP is u/FireMeaning**  **My (35/F) sister (25/F) has a bridesmaid (25/F) gone rogue.**  [Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3pz4oh/my_35f_sister_25f_has_a_bridesmaid_25f_gone_rogue/)  **Oct 23, 2015**  I will preface this by saying my parents gave my sister a choice: she gets a sum of money either to pay for her wedding, or to get set up with a house. My sister wisely chose to have the house, so her wedding is going to be a rather small affair she is paying for solo. I've been doing as much as I can to help with keeping her costs down (which, long story, was a lot). She asked me to be her maid of honor, and our brother, one of the groomsmen.  My sister has a bridesmaid who is a friend from college, Janet. I never cared for her, finding her rather rude and selfish, but its my sister's wedding, and I'm quite good at dealing with people. I ended up friending her on facebook.  The first issue between us came at a get together my sister hosted. Janet made a pointed comment to her boyfriend in front of me, saying she was surprised at my sister's bridesmaids, that if she was getting married, she would be sure that her bridemaids were ""thin, young and pretty"". It was obviously directed at me, as Janet and the other two bridesmaids are both very thin and younger. Frankly, it didn't bother me as a dig, I'm comfortable with my appearance and age, (and I'm a 22 BMI, so not unhealthy weight). It may have been due to the fact that I'm gay, and don't go for traditionally ""pretty"" looks.  The next issue though, came with the bridal shower. I planned it with two cousins. Janet decided last minute to plan a vacation over this time--and convinced another of the bridesmaid that it was really ""family only"" and that she wasn't welcome, despite being invited. She also posted a link to a thing about the top stupidest games played at showers on facebook.  If I wasn't sure this was intended maliciously towards me, I was after the bachelorette ",https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1q04eo7/my_35f_sister_25f_has_a_bridesmaid_25f_gone_rogue/

PoE,Temple is one of the most poorly telegraphed league mechanics in PoE history,906,269,2025-12-29,"Seriously, this mechanic is right on par with Betrayal and Harvest league in that almost nothing is properly explained and the player is required to watch a 30 minute youtube tutorial in order to even grasp how to properly engage with it.  But the worst part is that this isn't even just a min/maxing thing, it's understanding how any of the Temple mechanics work down to the most basic of things because even the fundamental mechanics aren't explained in an intuitive way.  Also at least Betrayal and Harvest, two PoE 1 league mechanics I would personally consider the most unintuitive, still felt rewarding even if you had no idea what you were doing. Temple doesn't feel like this at all. It feels like you either fully grasp the mechanic to setup rewarding rooms/bossing or you skip it entirely because it's so unbelievably time consuming/penalizing without exploits.  Which brings me to the next point, everyone currently enjoying this mechanic seem to be exploiting it or at the very least engaging with it in a way that clearly wasn't intended. I'm sorry but this current iteration of Temple feels rushed, incredibly unintuitive and overwhelmingly penalizing for players unfamiliar with the mechanic (which given that the game is technically unreleased would be the vast majority of players.. on release).   I know most of this was pretty negative so I at least want to end on a positive note. I think there's potential here, the idea of the temple as a whole is pretty cool. I think it mostly just suffers from what PoE notoriously suffers from, poor communication and a lack of intuitive design. Also, the theme of it all is incredible. Seriously, even when you activate the tablet to begin a temple run and the walls/path begin to move and that portal opens up.. pure cinema.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PathOfExile2/comments/1py6jod/temple_is_one_of_the_most_poorly_telegraphed/

Uber Unique,I wish more people appreciated Reckoning,325,115,2025-12-29,"When I see people talk about the great maps of BO6, it's always Terminus, Citadelle, and Shattered Veil. But Reckoning gets left out of that conversation often times when it actually does so much right:  1. The main quest feels the most classic of any BO6 map, with steps that are interchangeable and promote learning how to optimize the playspace similar to maps like Origins and Dead of the Night  2. The side EEs are easily the best selection in BO6. This includes EEs like the map-unique aether blade, the sharpshooter game, free loot bins, multiple free perks, free self revive, and aetherella companion, among others  3. The gameplay loop of this map is so damn good for high rounds. Upgrading all the caster turrets to their max, on top of using the aether blade for speed along with the gorgofex and free kazimirs, it creates the most unique high round experience in BO6  4. Reckoning gave us fully unique elite and special enemies in the Uber and Kommando Klaus. Players had been begging for map-unique enemies throughout the whole life cycle, and they finally gave it to us  5. We've never had a zombies map with two separate bossfights. While yes, Richtofen is a bit unbalanced, this feature provides an experience unlike any other zombies map   6. As much as some people like to hate on the Gorgofex, it's undeniable that it's capable of a ridiculous number of kills with each charge shot still only using 1 bullet",https://i.redd.it/8amjaogzsz9g1.jpeg

Unique,"None of Mel's abilities will get replaced because the designer wants to keep her ""uniqueness"" and ""identity""",3468,1652,2025-12-29,"Mel's gameplay designer recently said that none of her abilities will get replaced ([first instance](https://i.imgur.com/mTaWg3m.png) and [second instance](https://i.imgur.com/2NPna0S.jpeg)), and they will simply be tuned instead, because he wants to keep her ""uniqueness"" and ""identity"" (he said it [in this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/MelMains/comments/1pcf21y/context_for_incoming_mel_changes/)).  I know I'm preaching to the choir here, but I think it's important to talk about the projectile reflection again. This mechanic has no place in the game whatsoever, and I'll use an example to prove my point.  Let's say you're Vex (there are many examples like her). You're against Yasuo, and his Wind Wall is up. What do you do? You can use an ability to force him to use his Wind Wall, and then use his high cooldown to harass him. You lose your ability, and that's it. You can still interact with Yasuo.  Now let's say you're against Mel. If you ever throw a skill at her, you get destroyed because it will come back to you. So what do you do? Nothing. You literally can't interact with her. All you can do is watch her harass you and farm from afar. You can't force her W at all, so the only thing you can do is not play the game. High quality gameplay, right? And Vex is just an example. She's not alone in this case.  I know most of you are already aware of this, so why is Riot not getting rid of a mechanic that only makes the game much worse to play? Do we really have to keep a mechanic just because it was used in Arcane? Ekko can rewind time for everyone in the lore, yet he's not doing this in League of Legends. Lore isn't a good reason to make the game worse.  What do you think?",https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1pygndc/none_of_mels_abilities_will_get_replaced_because/

I started the season as a holy hammer thrower, shield-bashed my way to 60, and now I’m in T2 playing a Zeal build after finding a Red Sermon.  Each build I’ve played has felt uniquely powerful. My favorite part is how much you can lean into the role-playing aspect of each build. Right now I genuinely feel like a righteous Zealot, and it’s awesome.  One last thing I want to call out: even though the top meta builds rely on Arbiter, you don’t feel weak playing something else—you just aren’t god-like. I’m running Red Sermon Zeal with Consecration instead of Arbiter, and it feels totally viable.  Well done, Blizzard.

Competitor,My biggest competitor reached out to acquire me. The conversation taught me more about my business than 3 years of running it.,1322,195,2025-12-25,"Got an email a few months ago. The CEO of my biggest competitor wanted to chat. Assumed it was a trick or a scouting mission. Took the call anyway out of curiosity. They wanted to buy me. Real offer. Real number. Not life-changing money but meaningful. I didn't take it. But the process of considering it taught me a ton. They asked questions I'd never asked myself. What percentage of customers actually use the core feature? What's the real competitive moat? How replaceable am I personally to the business? What would break if I disappeared? What assets transfer versus what's just me? Had to actually find the answers. Some were uncomfortable. The moat I thought existed basically didn't. Turns out competitors could rebuild my product in 3-4 months. The thing I thought was defensible was just a head start. My personal involvement was more central than I'd admitted. Relationships I had with key customers, knowledge in my head, reputation I'd built. The business without me was worth a lot less than I assumed. But I also discovered strengths I'd undersold. Customer retention was higher than I realized. A segment I thought was small was actually growing fast. The word of mouth in a specific niche was stronger than any marketing I'd done. The acquisition didn't happen but the clarity was worth more than the offer. Highly recommend pretending someone wants to buy you and asking yourself the hard questions. You'll learn a lot.

Paladin,AURADIN: Every Question Answered - Between Genius and Laziness of the Holy Light Aura Paladin,1371,294,2025-12-24,"You have questions about Auradin? As an early christmas present, I have compiled all the answers for you.  I am sure many of you have asked themselves whether to use Herald of Zakarum, why Preacher is so good all of a sudden and if you actually need Hands to play this Build. I've received a ton of questions from the community and answered them as thoroughly as possible, based on my testing and expertise of the build. The most frequented question I see around this subreddit and other places, is how Holy Light Aura even works, so let's begin there:  **Holy Light Aura Mechanics**  TL;DR: Stack Attack Speed and use the Ceh Runes that spawns Wolves  * Holy Light Aura scales its damage linearly with Attack Speed, that is why we are stacking it. * Aura Potency from Sundered Night or other sources act as a direct damage multiplier. * Holy Light Aura emanates from all your allies, so each of your Ceh-Rune Wolves, replicate it. Your Mercenary does too. * Dawnfire deals Fire damage and benefits from +Ranks to Holy Light Aura and its Potency. * Dawnfire replaces your own Holy Light Aura, but your allies keep emanating it. * Dawnfire inherits most bonuses from Holy Light Aura, such as the Judicator Tag. * Dawnfire benefits from Aspect of Proselytizing  **What do the wolves even do?**  * They chill enemies they hit - being able to freeze them at multiple consequent hits. * They do apply vulnerable to the target they hit, but it is not consistent enough to not use an affix on the ring dedicated to it, because a lot of our multipliers depend on the enemy being vulnerable.  **Why are we using Preacher Paragon Board?**  TL;DR: It's much more damage.  Preacher's tooltip (as unfortunately so many in Diablo 4) is misleading and it actually gives much more damage than the description might insinuate.  The Damage Formula for Preacher is:      1 + (0.65 * [1 + Sum of Attack Speed])  Without any Attack Speed, this results in:      1 + (0.65 * [1 + 0]) = 1.65 =&gt; 65%[x] multiplier.

Rubberbanding,ATS Convoy Rubberbanding,0,20,2025-12-23,"I've been having difficulty in Convoy with a friend the last couple days, with really quite terrible rubberbanding that does almost make it impossible to play. At the minimum it makes the experience deeply uncomfortable and at times frustrating and stressful.  We started doing Convoy together earlier this past week, and our first session had no issues. The next time we played we added some truck and trailer mods to the mix, and that's when the rubberbanding started, if we were in the same vicinity as each other. It was late, so we didn't spend much time troubleshooting the session or playing very long. The next session we did troubleshooting as the problem had persisted. We tried using vanilla trucks, we tried deactivating our mods, we tried joining each other's convoys, we tried restarting convoys, restarting the game, restarting our PCs, none of it has worked. The last session we did went well for a while, we were back to no mods, but after about an hour it came back.  For reference, this isn't a minor issue, this is medium rubberbanding about every second to five seconds. Cruising down the highway it's typical to see trucks and ourselves rubberband around each other by about half a truck length. We both have high speed, stable internet, both up and down, with low latency usually less than 10ms since we are in the same city. We both have mid-high range PCs, 3080 and 4080 grade hardware. We play just the two of us in a friend's only lobby. We don't have issues in other games, and our first convoy session which lasted many hours went just fine.

Buff,"Now that Venti got buffed, how would you buff the rest of archons to make them viable again?",1532,428,2025-12-22,"I am talking of pre 4.0 archons of course. I don’t know if Furina will fall off the meta if they keep adding lunar reactions that cannot be buffed by her, or enemies that gives debuffs when you lose HP. Any the case, I believe Raiden should have a ER to Crit conversion when using her burst, as her weapon is ER, her artifacts give ER, and her ascension stat is ER, leaving Crit stats very low. Mine for example has 40 Cr &amp; 160 CD and the damage is very low. Apart from that, she could have her skill enhanced to damage enemies even if they have shields and give her another form of damage besides her ult. For nahida, her domain could automatically mark enemies that are within range rather than using her skill when there are multiple waves of enemies. Also she could buff dendro related reactions like lauma. Zhongli needs both application and damage, as his pillars are easily destroyed. I would recommend that the shield could be the source of damage and resonate with geo constructs, his dmg could scale more with HP, and his ultimate could increase atk/dmg based on his hp for the whole team.

Druid,Druid skills are quietly boosting a lot of other classes,563,197,2025-12-22,"One thing I don’t see talked about enough is how much Druid skill gems are helping non-Druid builds.  Warrior leveling feels way smoother now. Wolf skills as a bridge before Shield Wall fixes a long-standing pain point, and it actually speeds up early progression quite a bit for people racing to maps.  Plant-tagged gems are another sleeper hit. They open up some interesting CoC setups, especially for Blood Mage, which suddenly has new toys to play with instead of recycling the same old patterns.  Wolfpack is also surprisingly flexible. It’s an easy damage boost for summoner-style builds or anything that benefits from extra allies on the field.  And Oil Barrage? Niche, but some builds are already using it as a dedicated boss tool with decent results.  Overall, Druid didn’t just add a new class but also expanded the sandbox for everyone else.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PathOfExile2/comments/1psvt8e/druid_skills_are_quietly_boosting_a_lot_of_other/

Necromancer,[fan art] Necromancers of Canaan House,782,40,2025-12-22,"I finished my animated painting series of the Necromancers of Canaan House! The poem about the houses is so haunting and it’s really satisfying to have everyone together.   1. Judith - Particularly proud of the gold in her braids.  2. Ianthe - Corona’s in the background but our favorite insufferable bitch is front and center. Animation is supposed to be an eye roll.  3. Isaac - A friend looked over my shoulder while painting this one and asked if I was painting Edward Cullen. I think Isaac would be so into that comparison.  4. Abigail - Particularly proud of the animation of this one. Continuing the twilight trend, I think she kinda looks like Stephenie Meyer.  5.  Palamedes - This one really came together with his pale grey eyes.  6. Cytherea - Opted for her over Dulci to be more true to GTN. This one has the most frames for the blood drops.  7. Silas - Painting him walked the line between looking super old and young at the same time. I also developed a headcanon that his hair is white as a byproduct of the Soul Siphoning, pulling out all the pigment but the hair is thick and relatively healthy otherwise.  8. Harrow - I really enjoy this portrait of her. With how I paint, I render the whole face below the paint which is a little frustrating to cover it up but I can’t argue with the effect.

Spiritborn,Paladin is an absolute joy to play,597,240,2025-12-21,"Played every class as most have and there was always something that didn’t work for me:  - Druid: character model, when you transform you always look the same and there is no pure human build.  - Barbarian: lack of transmog flexibility with the arsenal systems (i.e you can’t  unequip stuff from a visual perspective and then 2H are further limited given certain abilities need a different type to be optimal), limited builds.  - Sorc: with few exceptions every build uses the same weapon combination. Obvious elemental items are often not utilised in builds. Internal build balance isn’t great.  - Rogue: just not my style but I do like the fact the class feels responsive and has both melee and range play styles that fill the Ranger/assassin type fantasy.  - Necromancer: second favourite class, not many complaints other than the minion AI can be very janky. Enjoy the Sever style but the attack animations looks funky with weapons and the blood skill options have never felt great to me.  - Spiritborn: plays and flows well, I just don’t connect with the class.    Which brings me to the Paladin…..  - Every skill feels thematic and visually impressive. Interactions are generally clear, obvious and easy to build around.   - there has been a clear attempt to differentiate 2H weapon builds, time will tell if that holds in reality.  - Arbiter, while I am not a fan of avatar skills that transform your class disabling transmogs, this one actually looks decent enough.   - Auras are just feel better than shouts in terms of feel and gameplay.   - maybe the class is just OP but most of the skills feel like you can build around them and do well. There are some like Heavens Fury that don’t seem to have a real home.   - Special mention to Auradin which I am glad Blizzard has made viable, very unique style, thematic and works great.  - Zeal feels and is just visually better than whirlwind and flurry.

Buff,"Three niche but ""realistic"" buffs for the One True Flag",5811,205,2025-12-21,"The idea was to think up small buffs that add to the utility of the flag while also adhering to the verisimilitude of the setting.      Historically, standard-bearers were the ones leading the charge into battles, and by wearing the Flag on your back (or waving it in your hands!) you'd be able to gather a small army of SEAF without having to explicitly seek them out; they're pretty effective at providing fire support, and just having a flag on your back can increase your firepower tremendously by way of picking up stragglers.  Meanwhile, planting the Flag in areas is an explicit declaration that you claim that territory - so naturally, SEAF forces in the vicinity should rally around it. This lets you designate important defensive locations (such as extraction zones, flag-raising missions, chokepoints near enemy outposts, etc) for SEAF to take positions at, allowing you to build up support elements without having to manually herd them to locations and tell them to hold position.  And finally, since we're raising flags to claim territory in the name of Managed Democracy, surely that means more flags is even higher levels of patriotism. Potentially leads to ""flag meta"" on those missions; it would be extremely funny seeing four flags taken, and even funnier if players kept them around and added more flags to each flag-raising as their flags came off cooldown (such as by transporting them stuck to an FRV; imagine a flag-raising mission that ends with 16 flags stuck into the roof of an FRV as a mobile beacon of democracy).",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1prkwnw

It feels like the game actively punishes you for playing solo. In a group, you just run one dedicated ""Rarity Bot"" stacked with MF gear, while the other 4 players (leechers) just juice the map difficulty and quantity without sacrificing their builds. They get exponential loot returns with zero downside.  Meanwhile, as a solo player, if I want good loot, I have to cripple my own character by wearing rarity gear, losing damage and survivability. If I play a strong build to clear content efficiently, I get zero loot.  The economy is already getting ruined because these groups are flooding the market with high-tier currency, making prices skyrocket for the rest of us.

Hidden entirely behind the drake’s blazing visage, its head swallowing his own as the fiery body draped down over his scales. You weren’t looking at a dragonborn anymore.

I noticed that guide recommends using Colossal glyph which, among other things, boosts damage with Gorilla skills. Since all of our damage comes from Eagle skills (Storm Feathers, Seeker and marginally Thunderspike) I don't see the point of glyph which boosts Gorilla skills. Of course, Colossal gives 2% more damage for every stack of Resolve AND 2.4% more damage to close enemies. While 2% more damage for every stack of resolve might seem OK I am usually further away from enemies so this other part (dmg to close enemies) doesn't always proc.   I am no expert so I am probably missing something here but couldn't we use some other, more useful glyph instead of this one? Maybe Exploit for speed running  and Fitness for pushing? Something else maybe?  ",https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1pr3puj/question_about_spiritborn_evade_build/

Sorcerer,"Will is a Warlock, not a Sorcerer",488,246,2025-12-19,"This is very much a nitpick but I feel within my right given that the most recent clip we’ve gotten from Vol. 2 is Mike and Erica arguing with everyone about the difference between Will being a wizard vs. a sorcerer. Honestly I had my opinions in Vol. 1 and was gonna let them go, but if the show is gonna go down this path then I will too.  I was kind of surprised at how they were hammering home that Will’s powers are “innate” when it’s canon that he is drawing them from Vecna. How is that innate? When he is away from Vecna (and we can assume that this will also be in play when Vecna inevitably dies) Will loses his connection. He tapped into the hivemind and harnessed Vecna’s abilities (hence the glazed over eyes and the similar manner to which he killed the demos). Innate is what El has, she was born with her powers and draws them from within.   If anything, Will is a warlock. Now, both the sorcerer class and the warlock class did not exist in the 80’s, so it’s not a stretch to say they could’ve just picked warlock. My reasoning is that warlocks form a pact with some superior entity who gifts them their powers, which is why a warlock’s abilities are always related to their patron. In my opinion this fits the exact situation of what’s happening with Will. Hell, even a wizard would make more sense considering they study to learn their powers.  Anyway, this is all very silly to be debating but just wondering if any other D&amp;D nerds were having the same thought",https://www.reddit.com/r/StrangerThings/comments/1pqkbeq/will_is_a_warlock_not_a_sorcerer/

Rogue,Thoughts on Rogues Getting Extra Attack?,2498,358,2025-12-19,"To my knowledge, one of the most common complaints with Rogues is their lack of Extra Attack. This also constrains their build options, as most builds multiclass at some point so they can pick it up. Using mods to give them extra attack not only makes monoclass rogue builds possible without being unoptimized, but also makes the later level subclass features relevant, as if you need to multiclass for Extra Attack, you won't get deep enough into rogue levels to unlock these features. Overall, this seems like a good way to unlock greater freedom when building rogues.  But how much does this impact balance? Obviously, getting Extra Attack is a massive buff. But from people who have tried doing this with mods, how did you feel it worked with the balance of BG3? **Did it still seem fair, or too strong?**     *Edit: Thanks for all the replies, but this post is getting too many replies for me to respond to them all, and I'm having to turn off reply notifications so my inbox isn't flooded with alerts.

One of them was the Hospital key that has like 10 containers max and brotha starts opening unopened ones and got mad when he got a Toro to the back of the head 🤷‍♂️ Whoops  Edit: To clarify, I am not trying to discourage pvp, say contesting key rooms is wrong, or saying if I unlocked the door that means the loot is mine. I'm simply saying I don't understand the behavior of people who clearly hear someone in a key or breach room and see it unlocked and think they will be met with kindness when they decide to walk right in. At no point did I say ""I spent a key and therefore you should leave and let me take the stuff without a fight"". I expect the opposite. Everyone is a threat outside that room and you'll be shot at the second you open the door if you want what's in it. Literally between this post and edit this happened again. I was on a night Buried City, I opened the breachable door in the 2 story under the overpass, looted half the room, a guy runs in and starts breaching the other side, I move, he stops and says he's friendly, starts again, I put 3 impacts on him and knocked him with my burletta. He starts a monolgue about how I'm a POS camper, and I should've just shared, and then starts in with racial slurs before I melee him to death. That ain't how it works bud.

Drop rate,Keep the blueprint drop rate,2577,721,2025-12-17,Whatever’s going on whether it’s a glitch or intentional I think embark should keep this drop rate or close to it going forward. Instead of sitting on gear and going with free load outs this incentivizes players to use load outs with safe pockets and get some skin in the game.   It also makes the PvP more fun for casual players because yeah you may lose a firefight or even get extract camped but you’ve got nice new glow stick blueprint crammed up your prison pocket so c’est la vie it’s worth it. Makes the sting of losing a loadout you worked on and paid for not as bad because you got something that moves the yardstick forward out of it.   It also incentivizes players to fight arc more because you actually have level 3 blueprints to craft so it’s worth trying to upgrade your benches.   What this game needs is to do better incentivize bold play. More pve’rs will come out of their shells and actually risk their biscuits and get into the upgrade rhythm instead of winging every time they lose a ferro 3 with full attachments because someone gunned them down when they said don’t shoot.   Of course the PvP needs to be tweaked a bit too (shooting first should not be so determinative) but this has been an interesting day on Arc after a few weeks of things feeling a bit stale.  ,https://i.redd.it/syov2mszno7g1.jpeg

It was precisely the type of role it seemed he'd been brought back to play.  But once Paul began playing it, the Clippers seemed to recoil. When he offered suggestions to a player about training methods, he was warned not to undermine the staff, sources said. When he'd challenge players on or off the court, or tell them how to run a play, there were complaints from both players and coaches that he was abrasive.  ""That's how Chris is,"" one executive with another team said. ""He wears you out. He's convinced he's right -- and he often is right, which kind of pisses you off -- and he'll go around to everyone until you agree with him.""  All this became even more pronounced in training camp, as Paul quickly became a standout as the leader of the second unit, which was routinely beating the starters.

Druid,A Plea to All Resto Druids,888,188,2025-12-16,"**ATTENTION ALL DRUIDS:**  Your guild masters are making rosters right now. They are slotting slotting you in on Dreamstate druid as we speak. They are making a huge mistake, and you need to stop them.  # Wait, what IS Dreamstate Druid?  Dreamstate Druid is a spec that all top 1% guilds run. It utilizes Improved Faerie Fire (+3% Hit, -610 Armor) and allows guilds to simply not bring a Boomkin anymore.  **TLDR:** Top 1% players use a Dreamstate Druid, because it will increase their speed kills, damage and parses.  # So why not just play Dreamstate Druid?  Here's the problem: EVERY player is starting to understand that Dreamstate Druid = more damage for their parses. EVERY player is starting to demand Dreamstate.  **Except Dreamstate Druids are extremely poor healers that will result in your raid dying unnecessarily a lot. Parses = fun. Repeatedly wiping because your healers are asleep = bad.**  # The Case for Tree of Life Druid  Tree of Life Druids are exactly who you want to see join your party. They understand their worth. They understand they are not there to simply ""press Faerie Fire on the boss."" They are in the raid to HEAL THE TANKS UNTIL THE BOSS IS DEAD.  **Imagine a healer that can join any nightmare demon run at 4 in the morning on Kael'Thas, or Magtheridon, and you INSTANTLY increase the changes of killing the boss.**  In a game where you just ""have to hope the healers are paying attention"" the Tree of Life Druid is ALWAYS paying attention. Tree of Life druids (when played correctly) can keep multiple tanks fully topped at all times.  * Your HOTs are way more effective than Dreamstate HOTs (+20% across the board, \~+80-100 healing received for anyone in your group)    * You can Swiftmend to instantly hit the tank for a huge heal (can't do this as Dreamstate)  # TLDR  Everyone is going to make you play shitty healing spec. Raids will then have unnecessary horrible tank deaths. Play good healing spec instead and make raids go smooth. Play Tree of Life Druid",https://i.redd.it/oe8cj2cyof7g1.png

Season 11,PSA - Guide to the secret Purified altar event in Season 11!,1075,248,2025-12-15,"So you've found a unique version of a seasonal consumable item and you wonder what it's used for. Here's the answer, in detail.  # How to get the purified consumables?  You can find the Purified Claw of Andariel, Eye of Belial, Horn of Duriel and Tongue of Azmodan as random drops from the lesser evils instead of the regular corrupted versions. Just kill the corresponding lesser evil to get the desired drop. The Infernal Hordes boss can also drop these.  # What to do with the purified consumables?  Take them to the altars around Sanctuary to activate them. Each altar has a corresponding Purified consumable, so four altars in total.  # Where are the altars?  * **Andariel's Altar** \- Nahantu, Seven Stones zone (northeast of Chakir stronghold) * **Belial's Altar** \- Fractured Peaks, Seat of the Heavens zone (east of the Zenith dungeon) * **Duriel's Altar** \- Kehjistan, Caldeum zone (west of the city's main gates) * **Azmodan's Altar** \- Hawezar, Umir Plateau zone (northeast area, the Lost City of Ureh)  # What happens if I activate all four altars?  A portal will appear at the last altar, taking you to a dark abyss where you fight all four lesser evils.  # What are the rewards?  You get a resplendent spark, a horse trophy cosmetic item, a bunch of corrupted seasonal consumables for each boss, and **1 of every unique from each boss's loot table, guaranteed to be ancestral**. Plus some random loot like runes and tributes.  https://preview.redd.it/jfc7mjfnbc7g1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=629ee75028cda67acc904f3efd926582e8b686ec  Hope this helps!",https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1pn3nqm/psa_guide_to_the_secret_purified_altar_event_in/

PoE,So I tried PoE and it was trash,0,11,2025-12-14,"First of all, despite being out for 10 years the game still feels rough around the edges. We're talking stuff like audio imbalances(some NPCs are way louder than others) or not all classes even being fully voice acted. Time of day is tied to a map, not actual time, which is extremely jarring and completely bizarre in a modern 3D game. The game is always online for absolutely no reason and not a single day has passed without at least one random disconnect. Even the UI is sloppy, what with ""Offense"" and ""Defense"" tabs being just giant lists and not telling you how much of your stats(if any) come from gear.  Love the big green ""SHOP"" button on the UI by the way. You need to open a menu to get to your quest list, but the SHOP is always there. lmao  The story pace is insane. When you learn that a boss exists you're like 30 minutes away from killing them. There is actually a lot of dialogue if you care to talk to NPCs, just don't talk for TOO long or the map instance will reset automatically. Yes, this actually happened to me more than once. Really makes you baffled at how retarded the entire design philosophy behind the game is.  Not much to say about the story, bad people do bad things so you kill them. It's actually quite confusing because people throw names of places or ""races"" that are in no way explained in the game and the fact it's a dead empire on top of another dead empire so you're working with three different timelines certainly doesn't help.  Lore-wise it's typical aRPG """"""dark fantasy"""""" slop which makes absolutely no sense if you give it minimum scrutiny, or in fact no scrutiny at all. The disconnect between the game trying to take itself seriously setting-wise and the actual mechanics where you just gleefully erease hordes of enemies so fast you can't even read their names is almost funny.  Speaking of, this is a point of contention on this sub so I think I should touch on that.

Then it stop generating value for blizzard.  Bringing back old Passes wouldn’t remove FOMO which is the main revenue factor for Overwatch’s battle passes. Old battle passes could return after a year delay, this would persevere urgency while turning existing content into revenue. Other games like Rivals have done this with great success.  This system wouldn’t be complicated (They literally have everything in game already) create a “Legacy Passes” tab, existing UI, and already created rewards. For collectors and newer players it removes the frustration of not getting a skin from 4 years ago while giving blizzard a clear low-cost win.  Call to action: Blizzard actively sends surveys through the Battle.net launcher, email, and their website (I did two this week). At the end, there’s a free-response box— use it. Even a simple line like “Please bring back old Battle Passes” is good enough for the keywords to track. Also forums posts would be good and making Reddit posts like this one.

Season 11,Great Job Blizz! Paladin and Season 11 are kickass!,740,329,2025-12-12,"My wife and I are loving the new content so far and are super excited to binge all weekend!   Playing a Disciple Paladin and the feel is awesome. Seems like a super fun and strong class with a lot of depth to it. You did it again and maybe even outdid yourselves after SpiritBorn!   The other adjustments are great too. The new enemy AI is really cool. We noticed it right away and were surprised when archers.. kind of circled us, shooting from afar. Rogues actually snuck up on us and acted shifty. Really cool and adds to the immersive feel!   It feels like we are continuing to get great new features and little bits of D2 and D3 added back in that worked really well before, all synthesized into the gorgeous package of D4.   Great new soundtracks too, BTW. I don’t think we’ve heard all the new ones but all the new ones so far are good.   Only level 40 so lots more to go but wanted to pop in and say awesome work! Love the new class! ",https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1pkohk8/great_job_blizz_paladin_and_season_11_are_kickass/

Shop,Honest Thoughts on TikTok Shop?,9,27,2025-12-12,"Okay, I may be biased since I work at a talent agency that has partnered with many TikTok Shop creators, but I genuinely think the platform is great. I’ve bought a fair amount through TT Shop, from protein bars to makeup, and you can really find some great deals.  It’s been over two years since TikTok Shop was introduced to the app, and the overall consensus is still pretty divided. A lot of people love it, whilst some think it’s ruining the app and compare it to shopping channels like QVC.  What's your honest thoughts on TikTok Shop? Have you bought anything off it? If so, how was your experience?",https://www.reddit.com/r/socialmedia/comments/1pk9er3/honest_thoughts_on_tiktok_shop/

Spiritborn,Diablo 4 : Lord of Hatred information,545,319,2025-12-12,"On April 28, 2026, the Age of Hatred Saga will reach its climax in Diablo IV: Lord of Hatred.  This expansion for Blizzard’s critically acclaimed ARPG unites a high-stakes campaign against Mephisto, two powerful new classes, the ancient and fabled region of Skovos, and sweeping gameplay updates that redefine how players experience Sanctuary. A pre-purchase grants immediate access to the highly requested Paladin class, offering a new path of divine retribution as darkness closes in.       AGE OF HATRED’S CULMINATION ●	FACE THE LORD OF HATRED: In the aftermath of Vessel of Hatred, this next chapter drives players toward their final stand against Mephisto, whose deception and spreading influence threaten to twist Sanctuary into a world consumed by malice. As Hell’s legions surge and the ancient Pools of Creation draw Mephisto ever closer, the fate of humanity hangs by a thread. To stop him, the Wanderer must embrace an old foe long believed to be dead. Lilith returns, her prophetic last words echoing true, forcing a perilous alliance bound by necessity rather than trust. With time and allies running out, the Wanderer is in a desperate race to stop Mephisto before hatred reshapes the world forever.    ●	POWERFUL NEW CLASSES: The Lord of Hatred expansion answers years of community demand with two distinct new classes, dramatically broadening how players shape their playstyle, identity, and mastery in Sanctuary. ○	The Paladin rises as the realm darkens, wielding hammer, shield, and Holy Light to smite Mephisto’s demon army with righteous fury. Through melee combat and divine abilities, the Paladin empowers players to strike with both unwavering faith and overwhelming force. ○	A second, yet-unrevealed class looms on the dark horizon—its power undeniable, its arrival poised to reshape the battlefield when Lord of Hatred launches in April.    ●	DANGEROUS LANDS: Skovos, the ancestral birthplace of the first civilization and the former home of Lilith and Inarius, stands as San",https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1pkgtho/diablo_4_lord_of_hatred_information/
